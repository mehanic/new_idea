There are several open-source alternatives to Google Maps API that you can use for mapping and geolocation services without Google's restrictions and costs. Here are some of the best options:

1. OpenStreetMap (OSM)
🌍 Best for: Free, community-driven maps
🔗 Website: https://www.openstreetmap.org

Description:
OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a crowdsourced map similar to Google Maps but completely free and open-source. It provides detailed mapping data that you can use in your apps.

APIs & Features:
OSM Tiles API – Basic map display
Overpass API – Query map data (e.g., find restaurants, roads, etc.)
Nominatim – Geocoding (convert addresses into coordinates)
Leaflet.js – JavaScript library for embedding OSM maps
Routing APIs – Use GraphHopper or OSRM for navigation
✅ Pros:
✔ Free and open-source
✔ No API key or billing required
✔ Community-updated data

❌ Cons:
❌ No built-in support like Google (need third-party services for routing, geocoding)

2. Leaflet.js
🗺️ Best for: Embedding maps in web apps
🔗 Website: https://leafletjs.com/

Description:
Leaflet is a lightweight JavaScript library for embedding interactive maps using OSM data. It’s an alternative to Google Maps JavaScript API.

Features:
Interactive map embedding
Custom markers, layers, and pop-ups
Mobile-friendly and fast
Uses OpenStreetMap as a data source
✅ Pros:
✔ Simple and fast
✔ No API key needed
✔ Open-source

❌ Cons:
❌ No built-in geocoding or directions (need external APIs)

3. MapLibre (Mapbox GL Alternative)
🗺️ Best for: High-performance vector maps
🔗 Website: https://maplibre.org/

Description:
MapLibre is a fork of Mapbox GL that allows rendering vector tiles with a fast, smooth experience. It is great for apps needing Google Maps-like styling and performance.

Features:
High-performance vector maps
3D map rendering
Works with OpenStreetMap
Fully customizable styles
✅ Pros:
✔ Smooth and interactive maps
✔ Works offline
✔ No Google restrictions

❌ Cons:
❌ Needs self-hosted tile server for full control

4. GraphHopper
🚗 Best for: Route planning & navigation
🔗 Website: https://www.graphhopper.com/

Description:
GraphHopper is an open-source routing engine that provides Google Maps-like directions. It supports car, bike, pedestrian, and transit routes.

Features:
Turn-by-turn navigation
Route optimization
Works with OpenStreetMap
✅ Pros:
✔ Free for basic use
✔ Multi-modal routing
✔ Offline support

❌ Cons:
❌ No built-in map rendering (needs Leaflet or MapLibre)

5. OpenRouteService
🚕 Best for: Advanced routing & geocoding
🔗 Website: https://openrouteservice.org/

Description:
A powerful alternative to Google Directions API. It offers routing, geocoding, isochrones, and matrix calculations.

Features:
Route calculation (car, bike, foot)
Isochrones (time-based map regions)
Geocoding API
✅ Pros:
✔ Free & open-source
✔ Supports multiple transport modes

❌ Cons:
❌ Rate limits for free users

6. OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)
🚦 Best for: Fast routing on OpenStreetMap
🔗 Website: http://project-osrm.org/

Description:
OSRM is a high-speed routing engine that provides Google Maps-like directions.

Features:
Lightning-fast route calculation
Uses OpenStreetMap data
Turn-by-turn navigation
✅ Pros:
✔ Super-fast API
✔ Free & open-source

❌ Cons:
❌ Needs hosting or third-party providers
